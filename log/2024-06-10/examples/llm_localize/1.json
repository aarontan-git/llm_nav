The reasoning for the estimated nodes at the previous timestep were described by {0: 'Pylon visible in the front view matches the landmark description for Node 0.', 1: 'Previous high probability but no chairs visible in the current view.', 2: 'Connected to Node 1, but no medical landmarks visible in the current view.'}. At each timestep, the robot may move to the next node (in the direction of node 9 to 0), and never moves backwards in nodes since the previous timestep.Predict the top 3 nodes where the robot has the highest probability of being at in the current timestep (requirement: 1 node minimum).",

          "content": "Based on the current front view image and the hand drawn map, the robot's position can be estimated as follows:\n\n1. **Node 0**: The front view image prominently features a pylon, which matches the landmark description for Node 0 (\"Pylon on the left\"). Given that the robot was previously estimated to be at Node 0 with a high probability (0.9), and considering the robot's movement constraints (it moves in the direction of node 9 to 0 and never moves backwards), it is highly likely that the robot is still at Node 0.\n\n2. **Node 1**: Node 1 is connected to Node 0 and has \"Chairs on the left\" as its landmark. Since no chairs are visible in the current front view, it is less likely that the robot has moved to Node 1. However, it remains a possibility if the robot moved forward.\n\n3. **Node 2**: Node 2 is connected to Node 1 and has \"medical on the left\" as its landmark. There are no medical landmarks visible in the current front view, making it unlikely that the robot has reached Node 2.\n\nGiven these observations, the estimated probabilities and reasoning for the robot's current position are:\n\n- **Node 0**: High probability due to the visible pylon matching the landmark description and the previous high probability at this node.\n- **Node 1**: Lower probability as there are no chairs visible, which should be present if the robot had moved to this node.\n- **Node 2**: Very low probability due to the absence of medical landmarks in the view.\n\nThe JSON output for the robot's estimated position would be:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"Node\": 0, \"Prob\": 0.9, \"Landmarks\": \"Pylon visible in the front view matches the landmark description for Node 0.\"},\n    {\"Node\": 1, \"Prob\": 0.1, \"Landmarks\": \"Connected to Node 0, but no chairs visible in the current view.\"},\n    {\"Node\": 2, \"Prob\": 0.0, \"Landmarks\": \"Connected to Node 1, but no medical landmarks visible in the current view.\"}\n]\n```"
