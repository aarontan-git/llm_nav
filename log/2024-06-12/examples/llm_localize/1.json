A traffic cone: It is orange and white, typically used for traffic control or marking hazards.\n2. Doors: There are multiple doors visible along the corridor, including a blue door at the end of the hallway.\n3.

          "content": "Based on the current observation and the hand drawn map, let's analyze the visible landmarks and their correlation with the map to estimate the current node:\n\n1. **Traffic Cone**: The presence of a traffic cone, which is typically used for marking or indicating a specific area, is noted in the hand drawn map near Node 1, labeled as \"pylon.\" This suggests proximity to Node 1.\n\n2. **Doors**: Multiple doors are visible in the corridor, including a distinct blue door at the end. The map does not explicitly mark doors except for the general corridor layout, which is common across many nodes. However, the presence of a specific colored door (blue) at the end of the corridor might be a unique identifier if it correlates with any specific node descriptions in future updates of the map.\n\n3. **Trash Can**: The trash can is located on the right side near the end of the corridor. This specific landmark is not noted on the map, but its presence on the right side might help in orientation if specific side-related landmarks are noted near any nodes in future updates.\n\nGiven the previous node estimation heavily favored Node 1 with a probability of 0.95 and the presence of a traffic cone (\"pylon\") which is specifically noted at Node 1, it is highly likely that the current position is still close to or at Node 1. The lack of any medical landmarks or devices rules out Nodes 2 and 3, which are characterized by such features.\n\nHere is the detailed JSON output of the current node estimation:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"Node\": 1, \"Prob\": 0.98, \"Landmarks\": \"High probability due to the visible traffic cone (pylon) which is a specific landmark for Node 1. The presence of multiple doors and a trash can supports the corridor environment typical for Node 1.\"},\n    {\"Node\": 2, \"Prob\": 0.01, \"Landmarks\": \"Low probability as there are no visible medical landmarks which are key features for Node 2.\"},\n    {\"Node\": 3, \"Prob\": 0.01, \"Landmarks\": \"Very low probability due to the absence of medical devices or medical landmarks, which are essential for Node 3.\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis estimation maintains a high probability for Node 1 based on the visible traffic cone and the general corridor layout, while assigning minimal probabilities to Nodes 2 and 3 due to the lack of their specific landmarks."
