Node 5 have landmarks: ['Computer'].\nNode 8 is connected to nodes: [7, 9]. Node 8 have landmarks: ['vending', 'maching'].\nNode 3 is connected to nodes: [2, 4].

The reasoning for the estimated nodes at the previous timestep were described by {2: 'Next logical node in path from node 1, leading towards node 3.', 3: \"Further along the path, contains 'medical device' landmark.\", 1: \"Possible minimal movement, previous location with 'Chairs' landmark.\"}. At each timestep, the robot may move to the next node (in the direction of node 9 to 0), and never moves backwards in nodes (0 to 9) since the previous timestep.Predict the top 3 nodes where the robot has the highest probability of being at in the current timestep (requirement: 1 node minimum).",

          "content": "Based on the front view image provided and the previous timestep's node estimates, the robot's current position can be analyzed as follows:\n\n1. **Previous Node Estimates**: The robot was estimated to be at nodes 2, 3, and 1 with probabilities of 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2 respectively.\n2. **Movement Direction**: The robot moves in the direction from node 9 to 0 and does not move backwards.\n3. **Current View Analysis**: The front view image shows a hallway with a traffic cone, which is not specifically listed as a landmark on the map. However, the presence of a hallway and the absence of any other distinctive landmarks (like chairs, medical devices, etc.) suggest a generic corridor location.\n\nGiven the movement direction and previous node probabilities:\n- **Node 2** (0.5 probability last timestep) connects to node 3.\n- **Node 3** (0.3 probability last timestep) connects to nodes 2 and 4.\n- **Node 1** (0.2 probability last timestep) connects to nodes 0 and 2.\n\nSince the robot moves forward and does not backtrack:\n- If at node 2 previously, the next logical node is node 3.\n- If at node 3 previously, the next logical node is node 4.\n- Node 1 is less likely as the robot moves forward, and node 1 would require moving to node 0 or back to node 2.\n\n**Estimation for Current Timestep**:\n- **Node 3**: High probability if moving from node 2.\n- **Node 4**: Next logical step if the robot was at node 3 and moving forward.\n- **Node 2**: Still a possibility if there was minimal movement from the last position.\n\n**Probabilities**:\n- **Node 3**: Likely moved here from node 2 or stayed if already there.\n- **Node 4**: Next in path if at node 3.\n- **Node 2**: Less likely but possible if minimal movement occurred.\n\n**JSON Output**:\n```json\n[\n    {\"Node\": 3, \"Prob\": 0.5, \"Landmarks\": \"Continued path from node 2, possibly still near 'medical device'\"},\n    {\"Node\": 4, \"Prob\": 0.3, \"Landmarks\": \"Further along the path from node 3, no specific landmarks visible in current view\"},\n    {\"Node\": 2, \"Prob\": 0.2, \"Landmarks\": \"Possible minimal movement, previously near 'medical' landmark\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis estimation considers the robot's movement direction, previous probabilities, and the lack of specific landmarks in the current view."
