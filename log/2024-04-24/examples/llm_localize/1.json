The reasoning for the estimated nodes at the previous timestep were described by {9: 'The robot is at the starting node facing a bulletin board.'}. At each timestep, the robot may move to the next node (in the direction of node 9 to 0), and never moves backwards in nodes (0 to 9) since the previous timestep.Predict the top 3 nodes where the robot has the highest probability of being at in the current timestep (requirement: 1 node minimum).",

Additionally, the presence of a door (door 7) next to the bulletin board matches the landmarks associated with Node 8. Given that the robot was previously at Node 9 and can only move forward in the sequence from Node 9 to 0, Node 8 is the most logical next position.\n\n2. **Node 7**: Although the primary evidence points to Node 8, Node 7 is the next node in sequence after Node 8 and also lists \"Bulletin\" as a landmark. It's possible the robot could have moved further along to Node 7, but this is less likely without seeing additional landmarks specific to Node 7 in the current view.\n\n3. **Node 9**: There is still a small possibility that the robot has not moved from its last known position at Node 9, especially if the movement was not detected or if the robot paused. However, this is less likely given the progression rule and the visible landmarks.\n\nThe estimated probabilities, based on the visible landmarks and the movement rules provided, are as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Node\": 8, \"Prob\": 0.8, \"Landmarks\": \"Bulletin board and door 7 visible, matching Node 8 landmarks.\"},\n  {\"Node\": 7, \"Prob\": 0.1, \"Landmarks\": \"Possible further movement to Node 7, which also lists Bulletin as a landmark.\"},\n  {\"Node\": 9, \"Prob\": 0.1, \"Landmarks\": \"Possibility of no movement from last known position at Node 9.\"}\n]\n```"
