PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION:

The estimated nodes were [9] at the last timestep, where the probability of each estimated node was described by {9: 1.0}. 
The reasoning for the estimated nodes at the previous timestep were described by {9: 'The robot is at the starting node with the vending machine on the left.'}.
PREVIOUS ACTION:

The last action you executed was MOVE_FORWARD, in the direction from Node 9 to 0.

You never move backwards. However, since your position in the real world is not limited to the Nodes described in the hand drawn map/graph, there are more positions than there are nodes, 
As a result, it is possible your current estimated nodes remain at the same as the previous estimated nodes.

CURRENT OBSERVATION:

In the image, the scene appears to be a corridor, likely within a building such as a school or office. Here are the objects and items visible within the scene:

1. **Bulletin Board**: On the left wall, there is a bulletin board with various papers or notices pinned to it. This is typically used for announcements or sharing information in a communal space.

2. **Doors**: There are multiple doors along both sides of the corridor. These are likely entrances to rooms or offices.

3. **Windows**: Above the doors, there are transom windows that allow light to pass through and may also serve for additional visibility into the rooms.

4. **Blue Handrails**: Running along both walls of the corridor at a lower height are blue handrails, which assist in mobility and safety.

5. **Ceiling Lights**: Although not to be focused on, it's observable that there are ceiling lights which illuminate the corridor.

6. **Floor Texture**: The floor has a textured appearance, possibly intended to prevent slipping.

7. **Distant Figures**: At the far end of the corridor, there appear to be figures, possibly people, though they are too distant to describe in detail.

These elements collectively suggest a functional space designed for accessibility and communication, typical of institutional settings like schools, hospitals, or office buildings.

Your front view also includes tv to the front.

LOCALIZATION QUESTION:

Using PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION, PREVIOUS ACTION, and your CURRENT OBSERVATION...

Please estimate your current position in the hand drawn map by selecting the top 3 most likely numeric nodes that represent your position in the real world.

First state your node estimates in detail using the hand drawn map, and the image from your front view.

Then, using your thought process, output your estimates in JSON format: [{{'Node': <node_number>, 'Prob': <node_probability>, 'Landmarks': <Estimation reasoning based on landmarks you see, and the hand drawn map. Think step by step and be as detailed as possible.>}}]

Your estimation must contain a minimum of one node. Only choose from the numeric nodes currently available.

NAVIGATION QUESTION:

Given:
The current navigation plan is: GO_STRAIGHT pass ['', 'vending on the left, maching on the left']

The next navigation plan is: TURN_LEFT at ['TV on the right']

The current estimated nodes are: [{0: 7, 1: 8, 2: 9}, {7: 0.9, 8: 0.1, 9: 0.0}, {7: 'Direct view of TV ahead, which matches the landmark for node 7 on the map.', 8: 'Possible transitional node from node 9 to node 7, but no specific landmarks visible in current view.', 9: 'Starting node, previously left, no longer matches current view.'}]

The previously executed action was: [9, 8, 7]

The previous observation includes: 

The current observation includes: tv to the front

The list of currently executable actions inclulde:

['GO_STRAIGHT', 'STOP', 'GO_BACK_TO_LAST_CHECKPOINT']

Answer the following two questions:
1. Based on your current/previous observation, previous action, and the next navigation plan, is the current navigation plan complete?
    - Example: if the current local plan is "GO_STRAIGHT pass [landmark_1, landmark_2, landmark_3]", have you passed it based on your current and previous observations? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the current local plan is "TURN_RIGHT at [landmark_1]", was your previous action TURN_RIGHT? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the next navigation plan is "TURN_LEFT at [landmark_1]", have you detected a left turn in your current observation? If so, it means that you have completed the current navigation plan.
2. If the current navigation plan is not complete, what is the best action (from the list of available actions) to execute? Select only ONE action.

Using the given information, answer the two questions above by reasoning step by step.
Output the response in JSON format: [{'Local Plan Complete Status': <"complete" or "incomplete">, 'Status Reasoning': <step by step reasoning with the example questions for the local plan complete status>, 'Action Reasoning': <step by step reasoning for which action to execute next>, 'Action': <selected_action>}]s

PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION:

The estimated nodes were [8, 7, 9] at the last timestep, where the probability of each estimated node was described by {8: 0.85, 7: 0.14, 9: 0.01}. 
The reasoning for the estimated nodes at the previous timestep were described by {8: 'Vending machine to the left, consistent with node 8 landmarks.', 7: 'TV to the right, consistent with node 7 but also visible from node 8.', 9: 'No specific landmarks for node 9 observed, unlikely position.'}.
PREVIOUS ACTION:

The last action you executed was MOVE_FORWARD, in the direction from Node 9 to 0.

You never move backwards. However, since your position in the real world is not limited to the Nodes described in the hand drawn map/graph, there are more positions than there are nodes, 
As a result, it is possible your current estimated nodes remain at the same as the previous estimated nodes.

CURRENT OBSERVATION:

In the image, I can see a hallway with several objects and features:

1. **Bulletin Board**: On the left side, there is a bulletin board mounted on the wall, filled with various notices or papers.

2. **Paintings/Posters**: Along the walls of the hallway, there are several framed paintings or posters.

3. **Handrails**: Both sides of the hallway are equipped with handrails, likely for safety and assistance.

4. **Doorways**: There are multiple doorways along the hallway, some appear to be open.

5. **Trash Can**: On the left side near the foreground, there is a trash can.

6. **Vending Machine**: Also on the left, there is a vending machine, possibly for snacks or drinks.

7. **Person**: At the far end of the hallway, there appears to be a person, possibly standing or walking.

These elements collectively suggest that the setting might be a public or institutional building such as a school, hospital, or office building.

Your front view also includes tv to the front.

LOCALIZATION QUESTION:

Using PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION, PREVIOUS ACTION, and your CURRENT OBSERVATION...

Please estimate your current position in the hand drawn map by selecting the top 3 most likely numeric nodes that represent your position in the real world.

First state your node estimates in detail using the hand drawn map, and the image from your front view.

Then, using your thought process, output your estimates in JSON format: [{{'Node': <node_number>, 'Prob': <node_probability>, 'Landmarks': <Estimation reasoning based on landmarks you see, and the hand drawn map. Think step by step and be as detailed as possible.>}}]

Your estimation must contain a minimum of one node. Only choose from the numeric nodes currently available.

NAVIGATION QUESTION:

Given:
The current navigation plan is: GO_STRAIGHT pass ['', 'vending on the left, maching on the left']

The next navigation plan is: TURN_LEFT at ['TV on the right']

The current estimated nodes are: [{0: 8, 1: 7, 2: 9}, {8: 0.85, 7: 0.14, 9: 0.01}, {8: 'Vending machine to the left, consistent with node 8 landmarks.', 7: 'TV visible to the front, consistent with node 7 landmarks.', 9: 'No specific landmarks for node 9 observed, unlikely position.'}]

The previously executed action was: [9, 8, 7]

The previous observation includes: tv to the front, vending to the left

The current observation includes: tv to the front

The list of currently executable actions inclulde:

['GO_STRAIGHT', 'STOP', 'GO_BACK_TO_LAST_CHECKPOINT']

Answer the following two questions:
1. Based on your current/previous observation, previous action, and the next navigation plan, is the current navigation plan complete?
    - Example: if the current local plan is "GO_STRAIGHT pass [landmark_1, landmark_2, landmark_3]", have you passed it based on your current and previous observations? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the current local plan is "TURN_RIGHT at [landmark_1]", was your previous action TURN_RIGHT? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the next navigation plan is "TURN_LEFT at [landmark_1]", have you detected a left turn in your current observation? If so, it means that you have completed the current navigation plan.
2. If the current navigation plan is not complete, what is the best action (from the list of available actions) to execute? Select only ONE action.

Using the given information, answer the two questions above by reasoning step by step.

The next navigation plan is: TURN_LEFT at ['TV on the right']

The current estimated nodes are: [{0: 7, 1: 8, 2: 9}, {7: 0.95, 8: 0.03, 9: 0.02}, {7: 'TV observed on the right, matching the map indication for Node 7. Corridor layout and additional features like doors and handrails support the typical hallway environment expected around Node 7.', 8: 'Absence of vending machine and mismatch of other specific landmarks for Node 8.', 9: 'Absence of specific landmarks for Node 9 and mismatch with current observation.'}]

The previously executed action was: [9, 8, 7]

The previous observation includes: tv to the left, Right turn detected

The current observation includes: tv to the right, Both left and right turn are detected

The list of currently executable actions inclulde:

['GO_STRAIGHT', 'STOP', 'GO_BACK_TO_LAST_CHECKPOINT', 'LEFT_TURN', 'RIGHT_TURN']

Answer the following two questions:
1. Based on your current/previous observation, previous action, and the next navigation plan, is the current navigation plan complete?
    - Example: if the current local plan is "GO_STRAIGHT pass [landmark_1, landmark_2, landmark_3]", have you passed it based on your current and previous observations? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the current local plan is "TURN_RIGHT at [landmark_1]", was your previous action TURN_RIGHT? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the next navigation plan is "TURN_LEFT at [landmark_1]", have you detected a left turn in your current observation? If so, it means that you have completed the current navigation plan.
2. If the current navigation plan is not complete, what is the best action (from the list of available actions) to execute? Select only ONE action.

2. **Rolling Chair**: There is a black rolling office chair with a higher backrest positioned slightly in front of the two blue chairs. It is placed on a small, dark-colored mat, likely to protect the floor or provide better maneuverability.

3. **Desk**: In front of the rolling chair, there is a small desk or table. It seems to be a typical office desk, possibly with wheels, as it is positioned on the same mat as the rolling chair.

These are the primary objects visible in the scene, focusing on the items as requested.

Your front view also includes chairs to the front, chairs_2 to the front.

LOCALIZATION QUESTION:

Using PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION, PREVIOUS ACTION, and your CURRENT OBSERVATION...

Please estimate your current position in the hand drawn map by selecting the top 3 most likely numeric nodes that represent your position in the real world.

First state your node estimates in detail using the hand drawn map, and the image from your front view.

Then, using your thought process, output your estimates in JSON format: [{{'Node': <node_number>, 'Prob': <node_probability>, 'Landmarks': <Estimation reasoning based on landmarks you see, and the hand drawn map. Think step by step and be as detailed as possible.>}}]

Your estimation must contain a minimum of one node. Only choose from the numeric nodes currently available.

NAVIGATION QUESTION:

Given:
The current navigation plan is: GO_STRAIGHT pass ['', 'Computer on the right', 'medical on the left, device on the left', 'medical on the left']

The next navigation plan is: TURN_RIGHT at ['Chairs on the left']

The current estimated nodes are: [{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3}, {1: 0.9, 2: 0.07, 3: 0.03}, {1: 'Presence of multiple chairs and a desk, closely matching the landmark description for Node 1.', 2: 'Possible proximity to medical landmarks, though not directly visible in the current view.', 3: 'Consideration due to connection to Node 2 and potential nearby medical devices not visible in the current view.'}]

The previously executed action was: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The previous observation includes: chairs to the front, chairs_2 to the front

The current observation includes: chairs to the front, chairs_2 to the front

The list of currently executable actions inclulde:

['GO_STRAIGHT', 'STOP', 'GO_BACK_TO_LAST_CHECKPOINT']

Answer the following two questions:
1. Based on your current/previous observation, previous action, and the next navigation plan, is the current navigation plan complete?
    - Example: if the current local plan is "GO_STRAIGHT pass [landmark_1, landmark_2, landmark_3]", have you passed it based on your current and previous observations? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the current local plan is "TURN_RIGHT at [landmark_1]", was your previous action TURN_RIGHT? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the next navigation plan is "TURN_LEFT at [landmark_1]", have you detected a left turn in your current observation? If so, it means that you have completed the current navigation plan.
2. If the current navigation plan is not complete, what is the best action (from the list of available actions) to execute? Select only ONE action.

Using the given information, answer the two questions above by reasoning step by step.

3. A trash can: Located on the right side near the end of the corridor, next to a door.

These are the primary objects visible in the scene, excluding the ceiling, floor, walls, and lighting as per your instructions.

Your front view also includes .

LOCALIZATION QUESTION:

Using PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION, PREVIOUS ACTION, and your CURRENT OBSERVATION...

Please estimate your current position in the hand drawn map by selecting the top 3 most likely numeric nodes that represent your position in the real world.

First state your node estimates in detail using the hand drawn map, and the image from your front view.

Then, using your thought process, output your estimates in JSON format: [{{'Node': <node_number>, 'Prob': <node_probability>, 'Landmarks': <Estimation reasoning based on landmarks you see, and the hand drawn map. Think step by step and be as detailed as possible.>}}]

Your estimation must contain a minimum of one node. Only choose from the numeric nodes currently available.

NAVIGATION QUESTION:

Given:
The current navigation plan is: TURN_RIGHT at ['Chairs on the left']

The next navigation plan is: GO_STRAIGHT until ['Pylon on the left']

The current estimated nodes are: [{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3}, {1: 0.98, 2: 0.01, 3: 0.01}, {1: 'High probability due to the visible traffic cone (pylon) which is a specific landmark for Node 1. The presence of multiple doors and a trash can supports the corridor environment typical for Node 1.', 2: 'Low probability as there are no visible medical landmarks which are key features for Node 2.', 3: 'Very low probability due to the absence of medical devices or medical landmarks, which are essential for Node 3.'}]

The previously executed action was: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The previous observation includes: chairs to the left, chairs_2 to the left, Both left and right turn are detected

The current observation includes: 

The list of currently executable actions inclulde:

['GO_STRAIGHT', 'STOP', 'GO_BACK_TO_LAST_CHECKPOINT']

Answer the following two questions:
1. Based on your current/previous observation, previous action, and the next navigation plan, is the current navigation plan complete?
    - Example: if the current local plan is "GO_STRAIGHT pass [landmark_1, landmark_2, landmark_3]", have you passed it based on your current and previous observations? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the current local plan is "TURN_RIGHT at [landmark_1]", was your previous action TURN_RIGHT? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the next navigation plan is "TURN_LEFT at [landmark_1]", have you detected a left turn in your current observation? If so, it means that you have completed the current navigation plan.
2. If the current navigation plan is not complete, what is the best action (from the list of available actions) to execute? Select only ONE action.

Using the given information, answer the two questions above by reasoning step by step.
Output the response in JSON format: [{'Local Plan Complete Status': <"complete" or "incomplete">, 'Status Reasoning': <step by step reasoning with the example questions for the local plan complete status>, 'Action Reasoning': <step by step reasoning for which action to execute next>, 'Action': <selected_action>}]s
RESPONSES:
Response Info: [{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3}, {1: 0.98, 2: 0.01, 3: 0.01}, {1: 'High probability due to the visible traffic cone (pylon) which is a specific landmark for Node 1. The presence of multiple doors and a trash can supports the corridor environment typical for Node 1.', 2: 'Low probability as there are no visible medical landmarks which are key features for Node 2.', 3: 'Very low probability due to the absence of medical devices or medical landmarks, which are essential for Node 3.'}]
Action Output: ```json
[
    {
        "Local Plan Complete Status": "complete",
        "Status Reasoning": "The current navigation plan is to TURN_RIGHT at ['Chairs on the left']. The previous action executed was a sequence of movements ending in a right turn (actions [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] where 1 represents the right turn). The previous observation included chairs to the left, which matches the landmark specified in the current navigation plan. Therefore, the right turn was executed as planned in the presence of the specified landmark.",
        "Action Reasoning": "Since the current navigation plan is complete, the next logical step is to proceed with the next navigation plan, which is to GO_STRAIGHT until ['Pylon on the left']. The front view image shows a pylon on the left, confirming that the environment matches the next navigation plan. Therefore, the best action to execute next is to GO_STRAIGHT.",
        "Action": "GO_STRAIGHT"
