NAVIGATION QUESTION:

Given:
The current navigation plan is: {local_plan}

The next navigation plan is: {next_local_plan}

The current estimated nodes are: {estimated_nodes}

The previously executed action was: {previous_action}

The previous observation includes: {previous_landmark_description}

The current observation includes: {current_landmark_description}

The list of currently executable actions inclulde:

{action_list}

Answer the following two questions:
1. Based on your current/previous observation, previous action, and the next navigation plan, is the current navigation plan complete?
    - Example: if the current local plan is "GO_STRAIGHT pass [landmark_1, landmark_2, landmark_3]", have you passed it based on your current and previous observations? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the current local plan is "TURN_RIGHT at [landmark_1]", was your previous action TURN_RIGHT? If so, it is complete.
    - Example: if the next navigation plan is "TURN_LEFT at [landmark_1]", have you detected a left turn in your current observation? If so, it means that you have completed the current navigation plan.
2. If the current navigation plan is not complete, what is the best action (from the list of available actions) to execute? Select only ONE action.

Using the given information, answer the two questions above by reasoning step by step.
Output the response in JSON format: [{{'1. Status Reasoning': <step by step reasoning with the example questions for the local plan complete status>, '1.1. Local Plan Complete Status': <"complete" or "incomplete">, '2. Action Reasoning': <step by step reasoning for which action to execute next>, '2.1. Action': <selected_action>}}]s
