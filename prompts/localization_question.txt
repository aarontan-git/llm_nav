LOCALIZATION QUESTION:

Using PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION, PREVIOUS ACTION, and your CURRENT OBSERVATION...

Please estimate your current position in the hand drawn map by selecting the top 3 most likely numeric nodes that represent your position in the real world.

First state your node estimates in detail using the hand drawn map, and the image from your front view.

Then, using your thought process, output your estimates in JSON format: [{{'Node': <node_number>, 'Prob': <node_probability>, 'Landmarks': <Estimation reasoning based on landmarks you see, and the hand drawn map. Think step by step and be as detailed as possible.>}}]

Your estimation must contain a minimum of one node. Only choose from the numeric nodes currently available.
