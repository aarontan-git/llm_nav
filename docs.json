    "question": "PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION:\n\nThe estimated nodes were [1, 2, 3] at the last timestep, where the probability of each estimated node was described by {1: 0.98, 2: 0.01, 3: 0.01}. \nThe reasoning for the estimated nodes at the previous timestep were described by {1: 'High probability due to the visible traffic cone (pylon) which is a specific landmark for Node 1. The presence of multiple doors and a trash can supports the corridor environment typical for Node 1.', 2: 'Low probability as there are no visible medical landmarks which are key features for Node 2.', 3: 'Very low probability due to the absence of medical devices or medical landmarks, which are essential for Node 3.'}.\nCURRENT OBSERVATION:\n\nIn the image, I can see a traffic cone prominently placed on the left side of the hallway. Further down the hallway, there is a wheelchair positioned near the wall on the right side. There are also doors along the hallway, some of which are open, and others are closed.\n\nYour front view also includes pylon to the left, Left turn detected.\nLOCALIZATION QUESTION:\n\nUsing PREVIOUS NODE ESTIMATION, PREVIOUS ACTION, and your CURRENT OBSERVATION...\n\nPlease estimate your current position in the hand drawn map by selecting the top 3 most likely numeric nodes that represent your position in the real world.\n\nFirst state your node estimates in detail using the hand drawn map, and the image from your front view.\n\nThen, using your thought process, output your estimates in JSON format: [{{'Node': <node_number>, 'Prob': <node_probability>, 'Landmarks': <Estimation reasoning based on landmarks you see, and the hand drawn map. Think step by step and be as detailed as possible.>}}]\n\nYour estimation must contain a minimum of one node. Only choose from the numeric nodes currently available.\n",
